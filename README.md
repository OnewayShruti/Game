## Getting Started

To play the game, you can run the `script.js` file in a JavaScript environment that supports the `prompt` function (like a web browser).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) to run the game.

### How to Play

1. Open the `script.js` file in a browser console or include it in an HTML file.
2. The game will prompt you to enter your choice: **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The game will announce the winner of each round and keep track of the scores.
5. After three rounds, the game will declare the overall winner.

### Game Logic

- The game is played in three rounds.
- Each round, both the player and the computer choose one of the three options.
- The winner of each round is determined by the rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
